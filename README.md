The Realtime Device Tracker is a web-based application that allows real-time tracking of connected devices on an interactive map. 
This project leverages Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and Leaflet.js to provide a dynamic and responsive tracking experience, where users can see devices move in real-time.
